## The human-animal connection

Why do some people (not all) feel such strong empathy toward animals? In some cases, this connection even surpasses the empathy we feel toward other humans. I don’t want to generalize, but in my life, one of the purest, most sincere, and loyal relationships I have is with Sasha. Besides their inherent innocence, the depth of love that animals have comes from the fact that they don’t know anything else. For that reason, they give everything to the person who cares for them, feeds them, or simply shows them a little love. Often, it happens that...

## If everyone were happy, the world would be a better place

I always think this, and as time goes on, i’m more convinced of it. Most people (or nearly everyone) follow the same pattern: the happier they are, the better they make the world. That’s how i see it. Every action triggers a reaction, but it’s a whole different story when the action is genuine and doesn’t come with any obvious benefit. It’s just an act. An act of what, though? I can’t quite put a name to the emotion behind it—it's not empathy, and it’s not love either. Maybe some people are just born with that gift, and no one really notices or takes it seriously.

## Pride as a Shield for Fear

When i started college, i met one of the smartest people i know, and we're still friends today. I’m someone who really observes people—it's something i enjoy and often do without even thinking about it. To me, intelligence isn’t just about being good at math, problem-solving, or creativity; it’s a mix of technical skills and emotional intelligence. I’m bringing this up because back in 2018, we wrote a paper about emotions, specifically the direct connection between fear and pride. The theory ended up feeling incomplete because we hit a bit of a dead end, or at least it seemed that way to us. After all, we were dealing with a soft science where everything depends on individual perspectives, experiences, and perceptions. I’d read that blog post a thousand times over, but now it only exists somewhere deep in a Reddit subforum—I’ve never been able to find it again.
